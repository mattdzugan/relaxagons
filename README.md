# Relaxagons

This repository contains the deployed code for the [twitter bot @relaxagons](https://twitter.com/relaxagons).

The bot is hosted on Heroku.

This repo is poorly managed mishmash of
- heroku / bot infrastructure
- twitter infrastructure
- math to make cool hexagon things

If you came here looking for **math to make cool hexagon things**, I'd recommend checking out the [observable notebook](https://observablehq.com/d/20e0c74abc6c4784) where that code _(and nothing more)_ is on display and you can mess with the parameters yourself!
